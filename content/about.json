  "title": "About me.",
  "description": "My passion for frontend development ignited like wildfire when I watched a YouTube video of a developer creating a landing page from scratch using just HTML and CSS. The process was mesmerizing, and it opened my eyes to the incredible possibilities of web development. For the past three years, I've honed my skills working as a Fullstack and Frontend Developer for both SaaS startups and a boutique outsourcing company. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing tennis once a week, exploring new content on YouTube, or indulging in my love for food with my fiance."
